PASS 1 – negative cases summary
===============================

Should produce an error (fail in Pass 1)
-------------------------------------------

addressing-mode-not-allowed-for-dest/
  Goal: dest uses an illegal addressing mode for the opcode.
  Example:  mov r1, #5
  Expect:   addressing mode not allowed for destination

addressing-mode-not-allowed-for-source/
  Goal: source uses an illegal addressing mode for the opcode.
  Example:  lea #5, r1
  Expect:   addressing mode not allowed for source

comma-not-in-right-place/
  Goal: misplaced comma in a directive/operands.
  Example:  .data ,5    (or)  .data 1,,2
  Expect:   malformed .data list

define-as-extern-and-inside/
  Goal: symbol declared .extern and later defined as label/data/code.
  Example:  .extern X   /   X: .data 1
  Expect:   cannot define external symbol 'X' (declared extern at line 1)

double-external-decleration/
  Goal: same symbol .extern twice.
  Example:  .extern Y   /   .extern Y
  Expect:   cannot define external symbol 'Y' (declared extern at line 1)

duplicate-extern-and-entry/
  Goal: .entry on a symbol that is also .extern.
  Example:  .extern EXT   /   .entry EXT
  Expect:   symbol 'EXT' marked .entry but also declared .extern

duplicate-label/
  Goal: two definitions of the same label.
  Example:  MAIN: mov r1, r2   /   MAIN: add r2, r3
  Expect:   duplicate label 'MAIN' (previously defined at line 1)

define-label-as-instruction/
  Goal: label name equals an instruction/directive (reserved).
  Example:  add: .data 1,3
  Expect:   illegal label name 'add' (reserved)

deplicate-macro-and-label/
  Goal: label name duplicates an existing macro name.
  Example:  mcro HELLO … mcroend / HELLO: mov r1, r2
  Expect:   label 'HELLO' conflicts with macro name

illegal-label2/
  Goal: illegal label syntax (e.g., space before colon).
  Example:  LBL : mov r1, r2
  Expect:   illegal label name 'LBL '

illegal-label3/
  Goal: illegal label syntax (starts with a digit).
  Example:  1LB: mov r1, r2
  Expect:   illegal label name '1LB'

label-without-statement/
  Goal: naked label with nothing after the colon.
  Example:  ONLY_LABEL:
  Expect:   illegal label name 'ONLY_LABEL'   (strict spec: '_' not allowed)
            # If testing a valid name like ONLYLABEL:, expect: label without statement

missing-dest-operand/
  Goal: two-operand instruction with nothing after the comma.
  Example:  mov r1,
  Expect:   missing destination operand

missing-quote-in-string/
  Goal: .string without closing quote.
  Example:  .string "hi
  Expect:   missing closing quote in .string

missing-source-operand/
  Goal: two-operand instruction with nothing before the comma.
  Example:  mov , r2
  Expect:   missing source operand

no-comma/
  Goal: missing comma between instruction operands.
  Example:  mov r1 r2
  Expect:   expected comma between operands

no-comma-between-numbers/
  Goal: missing comma between .data numbers.
  Example:  .data 1 2
  Expect:   malformed .data list

non-numeric-item-in-data/
  Goal: non-numeric token in .data list.
  Example:  .data 5, xyz
  Expect:   malformed .data list

too-much-comma/
  Goal: double/trailing comma in .data.
  Example:  .data 7,, -57
  Expect:   malformed .data list

too-much-operands/
  Goal: extra operand for a 1-operand opcode.
  Example:  not r1, r2
  Expect:   unexpected text after instruction

unexpected-text-after-string/
  Goal: trailing garbage after a valid .string.
  Example:  .string "hi" xyz
  Expect:   unexpected text after .string

unexpected-text-in-data/
  Goal: trailing garbage after a valid .data list.
  Example:  .data 1, 2 xyz
  Expect:   malformed .data list

unknown-directive/
  Goal: dot-directive that isn’t supported.
  Example:  .unknown 1,2,3
  Expect:   unknown directive

unknown-mnemonic/
  Goal: misspelled/unknown instruction.
  Example:  muv r1, r2
  Expect:   unknown mnemonic 'muv'

unknown-mnemonic2/
  Goal: another unknown mnemonic spelling.
  Example:  stopp
  Expect:   unknown mnemonic 'stopp'

zero-operand-inst-with-operand/
  Goal: zero-operand opcode given an operand.
  Example:  rts r1
  Expect:   unexpected text after zero-operand instruction


 No-error cases (allowed by spec; should pass in Pass 1)
---------------------------------------------------------

label-before-entry/
  Goal: label attached to .entry line is meaningless.
  Example:  L: .entry A
  Expect:   label is ignored (no error)

label-before-extern/
  Goal: label attached to .extern line is meaningless.
  Example:  L: .extern A
  Expect:   label is ignored (no error)
